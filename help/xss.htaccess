#gecko browsers (FireFox) has very strict XSS rules and even disallow fonts from third domain sources
#to allow these fonts to be loaded, you can use the following three lines of Apache configuration

<FilesMatch "\.(ttf|ttc|otf|eot|woff|svg|pfa|ps)$">
    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
        Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
        Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, x-requested-with, content-type"
        Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET"
    </IfModule>
</FilesMatch>
