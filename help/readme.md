#Apache .htaccess examples and info

a few PWP users have some problems with misconfigured Apache Servers, so we added this .htaccess files you can use, if you have configuration problems.  

[.htaccess info from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htaccess)  

A .htaccess (hypertext access) file is a directory-level configuration file supported by several web servers, that allows for decentralized management of web server configuration. They are placed inside the web tree, and are able to override a subset of the server's global configuration for the directory that they are in, and all sub-directories.  
The original purpose of .htaccess—reflected in its name—was to allow per-directory access control, by for example requiring a password to access the content. Nowadays however, the .htaccess files can override many other configuration settings including content type and character set, CGI handlers, etc.  

It is important, that the filename is exactly **.htaccess**
