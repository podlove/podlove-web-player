HTML5 Goodness for Podcasting

Podlove Web Player is a Podcast-optimized, HTML5-based video and audio player with Flash fallback. It can be used as a WordPress plugin or within a static HTML/JavaScript context.

The Podlove Web Player supports almost every browser and also does captions, chapters and much more. Thanks to MediaElement.js for providing the foundation.
