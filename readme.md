## About

HTML5 Goodness for Podcasting

Podlove Web Player is a Podcast-optimized, HTML5-based video and audio player with Flash fallback.
It can be used as a WordPress plugin or within a static HTML/JavaScript context.

The Podlove Web Player supports almost every modern browser and also does captions, chapters and much more.
Thanks to MediaElement.js for providing the foundation.

## Build JavaScript

We will replace *make* with *grunt.js* or *gulp.js* in combination with *browserify*.

Install prerequisites for building:

    npm install -g browserify

Create podlove-web-player/static/podlove-web-player.js with

    browserify js/main.js -o static/podlove-web-player.js

## Build CSS

### Setting up the ruby environment

       $ gem update --system

### Install SASS

* [Official SASS site](http://sass-lang.com/install)


    gem install sass

or

    sudo gem install sass

Then check your version

    sass -v

### Install SASS CSS Importer

Next you need to installe the [SASS CSS Importer](https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-css-importer) ruby gem.

    $ gem install --pre sass-css-importer

### Install Compass

* [Official Compass site](http://compass-style.org/install/)

Compass runs on any computer that has ruby installed.

Then install compass

    $ gem install compass

The Compass settings can be found in this file:

    podlove-web-player/config.rb

To enable the debugging comments that display
the original location of your selectors, comment-in following line:

    line_comments = false

### Build the CSS file

In the command line, navigate to your working directory and compile the output css with

    compass compile

For development you should add a watcher with the command

    compass watch

Finally, for a compressed and minified production file, just run the command:

    compass compile --output-style compressed

## Test

No automated tests, yet. Sorry.
But with `http-server` npm module you can serve the repository root directory statically for manual local frontend testing.
You can then access the examples with your browser via `http://localhost:8080/example/index.html`.

## Info

**Important!**
The Wordpress-plugin that includes the Podlove-Webplayer alone will be moved to its own repo.
