HTML5 based audio/video player, focused on podcasts and similar media blogs. It supports chapters, deeplinks, captions, social media buttons and more.

## Description

This is part of the “Podlove” initiative for a better podcasting experience. See <a href="http://podlove.org">podlove.org</a> for more information.

There are basically four ways to use the Podlove Web Player:

### 1) as a Standalone Player

You won’t need any of the PHP or WordPress files in this package. Just stick to "standalone.html" and see how it’s done there. Maybe you want to build your very own CMS plugin. If so – let us know!

### 2) manual WordPress shortcodes

Use a simple shortcode in your posts and pages, and the Podlove Web Player will appear, playing any media file you want to assign. Basic usage:

   [podloveaudio src="http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp3" duration="03:33" title="My track"]   

### 3) WordPress enclosures

The WordPress plugin searches for media enclosures in your existing posts and renders a web player automatically. Works like a charme, even for Blubrry PowerPress users.

### 4) as part of the Podlove Podcast Publisher

This player is bundled with the <a href="http://podlove.org/podlove-podcast-publisher">“PPP” project</a> and should be automatically rendered, so you don’t have to worry about anything.

    [podlovevideo autoplay="true"]

### fullscreen

    [podlovevideo fullscreen="false"]

### duration

    [podlovevideo duration="3522"]
    [podloveaudio duration="00:58:42"]

### alwaysShowHours

    [podloveaudio alwaysShowHours="false"]  

### alwaysShowControls

### chapters

Takes chapter json string from the defined custom field (the standard WordPress ones) and builds an interactive chapter table. Can be referenced to an external json file, too. Chapters must be written in the following format:

```json
[{  
  "start": "00:00:00",    
  "title": "foo",    
  "href": "http://podlove.org",    
  "image":""  
},{  
  "start": "00:01:00",    
  "title": "lorem",    
  "href": "https://github.com/podlove/",    
  "image":"samples/coverimage-red.png"  
},{  
  "start": "00:02:30",    
  "title": "ipsum",    
  "href": "https://github.com/shownotes/",    
  "image":"samples/coverimage-green.png"  
},{  
  "start": "00:03:00",    
  "title": "end",    
  "href": "",    
  "image":"samples/coverimage-blue.png"  
}]  
```

* "start" has to be defined as HH:MM:SS
* "title" is the name of the chapter
* "href" is an optional URL
* "image" is an optional image URL or relative path

    [podloveaudio chapters="my_chapter_field"]  
    [podloveaudio chapters="http://mychapters.com/chapters.json"]  

### chaptersVisible / timecontrolsVisible / summaryVisible

Defines the default visibility status of toggable player modules. Standard value is "false".

    [podloveaudio chaptersVisible="true" timecontrolsVisible="false" summaryVisible="false"]

### Rich Podlove Web Player player with meta information

**If you have an audio file and use one of the following attributes, the player will sport a richer visual experience:** "title", "subtitle", "summary", "poster", "permalink". Full example:  

    [podloveaudio mp3="http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp3" ogg="http://mysite.com/mymedia.ogg" title="PWP – First show" subtitle="We talk about this and that" summary="Here goes a summary of the episode which should be about 256 characters long" poster="http://mysite.com/mymedia.jpg" chapters="my_chapter_field" permalink="http://mysite.com/my-first-episode/"]

### Podlove Web Player Shortcode in multiple lines

Don't do it, always write the shortcode in a single line.

### Deprecated usage

Chapters now handed over as JSON, please take a look at the standalone.html. The previous solution will still work, however we recommend to use the new solution, as it offers some more features.
**Earlier versions of this plugin could handle alternative shortcodes, too:** [audio] and [video]. As of version 1.1, these are deprecated as they conflict with other plugins.
