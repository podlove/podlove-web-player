HTML5 based audio/video player, focused on podcasts and similar media blogs. It supports chapters, deeplinks, captions, social media buttons and more.

## Description

This is part of the “Podlove” initiative for a better podcasting experience. See [podlove.org](http://podlove.org) for more information.

There are basically four ways to use the Podlove Web Player:

### 1. as a Standalone Player

You won’t need any of the PHP or WordPress files in this package. Just stick to "standalone.html" and see how it’s done there. Maybe you want to build your very own CMS plugin. If so – let us know!

### 2. manual WordPress shortcodes

Use a simple shortcode in your posts and pages, and the Podlove Web Player will appear, playing any media file you want to assign. Basic usage:

    [podloveaudio src="http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp3" duration="03:33" title="My track"]

### 3. WordPress enclosures

The WordPress plugin searches for media enclosures in your existing posts and renders a web player automatically. Works like a charme, even for Blubrry PowerPress users.

### 4. as part of the Podlove Podcast Publisher

This player is bundled with the [“PPP” project](http://podlove.org/podlove-podcast-publisher) and should be automatically rendered, so you don’t have to worry about anything.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### loop

    [podlovevideo src="http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp4" loop="true"]

### preload

Start loading the video as soon as possible, before the user clicks play. This might not work on all browsers.

    [podloveaudio preload="true"]

### autoplay

Start playing the video as soon as it's ready. This might not work on all (mobile) devices.

    [podlovevideo autoplay="true"]

### fullscreen

Disables the fullscreen button for video:

    [podlovevideo fullscreen="false"]

### duration

Enables display of duration without having to load the media file. Use seconds or timecode as a unit:

    [podlovevideo duration="3522"]
    [podloveaudio duration="00:58:42"]

### alwaysShowHours

Displays the time in 00:00:00 instead of 00:00. Default is "true".

    [podloveaudio alwaysShowHours="false"]

### alwaysShowControls

Defines whether the player control bar is permanently visible. For videos, it might be suitable to fade the controls out when not hovering the video.

    [podlovevideo alwaysShowControls="false"]

### volume

    [podloveaudio volume="false"]

### progress

    [podlovevideo progress="false"]

### captions

URL to a WebVTT captions file:

    [podlovevideo captions="http://mysite.com/mymedia.vtt"]

### chapters

Takes chapter string from the defined custom field (the standard WordPress ones) and builds an interactive chapter table. Can be referenced to an external text file, too.

    [podloveaudio chapters="my_chapter_field"]
    [podloveaudio chapters="http://mychapters.com/chapters.txt"]

Chapters must be written in the following format:

    00:00:00.000 Introduction
    00:00:57.099 First chapter title
    00:10:03.104 Second chapter title
    00:12:44.625 Final chapter

### chapterlinks

Option for the jumplink behaviour in chapter table

    [podloveaudio chapterlinks="all"] (default, all chapter links are clickable)
    [podloveaudio chapterlinks="buffered"] (only buffered chapters are clickable)
    [podloveaudio chapterlinks="false"] (chapters are not linked)

### chaptersVisible / timecontrolsVisible / summaryVisible

Defines the default visibility status of toggable player modules. Standard value is "false".

    [podloveaudio chaptersVisible="true" timecontrolsVisible="false" summaryVisible="false"]

### Rich Podlove Web Player player with meta information

If you have an audio file and use one of the following attributes, the player will sport a richer visual experience: "title", "subtitle", "summary", "poster", "permalink". Full example:

    [podloveaudio mp3="http://mysite.com/mymedia.mp3" ogg="http://mysite.com/mymedia.ogg" title="PWP – First show" subtitle="We talk about this and that" summary="Here goes a summary of the episode which should be about 256 characters long" poster="http://mysite.com/mymedia.jpg" permalink="http://mysite.com/my-first-episode/"]


### Deprecated usage

Chapters now handed over as JSON, please take a look at the standalone-json.html. The previous solution will still work, however we recommend to use the new solution, as it offers some more features.
Earlier versions of this plugin could handle alternative shortcodes, too: [audio] and [video]. As of version 1.1, these are deprecated as they conflict with other plugins.

## Screenshots
